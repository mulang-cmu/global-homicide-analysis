# global-homicide-analysis
A global panel analysis (2005-2022) using Negative Binomial Fixed Effects to analyze the link between GDP and homicide.
# Global Homicide & Wealth Analysis (PDA Research)

## Project Overview
This study examines the relationship between national income and intentional homicide using a global country-year panel spanning 2005 to 2022 across 166 countries.

## Key Technical Details
- **Models Used:** Negative Binomial Fixed Effects (NB-FE) and Poisson models to handle overdispersed count data.
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), R/Stata for econometric modeling.
- **Key Finding:** Identified that a one-unit increase in log GDP per capita is associated with a 25.5% reduction in homicide incidence.
